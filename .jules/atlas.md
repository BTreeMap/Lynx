## 2026-02-28 - API pagination and redirect code drift
**Learning:** The README API examples used `offset=0` (traditional pagination) but the actual `ListQuery` struct in `src/api/handlers.rs` accepts `limit` + `cursor` (cursor-based pagination). The redirect default was documented as 301 but the `RedirectMode::default()` in `src/config/mod.rs` is 308. Additionally, `ENABLE_TIMING_HEADERS` was read in `src/main.rs` but missing from both README and `.env.example`.
**Action:** Always verify pagination parameters by checking the handler's query struct, not just the route definition. Check `src/main.rs` for env vars beyond `src/config/mod.rs` since some config (like `ENABLE_TIMING_HEADERS`) is parsed directly in main. Run `scripts/check-docs-drift.sh` to catch route and env var drift.
